```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(pheatmap)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

```

This is the analysis for a very important question: Are there patterns in how individuals rank the LoTR book series?

First, we will gather crucial data: individuals personal ranking of the six books from best to worst. Next, we will visualize with heatmaps clustered using any algorithm that makes it look interesting. 


```{r data_summary}

rank_data <- read.csv(here("Data", "rankings.csv")) 
rank_data <- rank_data %>%
  column_to_rownames("Name")

```



```{r plot_heatmap}

pheatmap(rank_data, filename = here("heatmap_defaults.pdf"), cellwidth = 50, cellheight = 10, angle_col = "45")

```
